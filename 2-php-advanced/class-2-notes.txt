CLASS 2 - PHP ADVANCED
https://gitlab.aofl.com/kristopher.thomson/qdev-utils

- refactor to not have multiple returns

- rewrite adding fractions as a class
- needs better output

- keep track of cards as objects (value, suit, type)
- keep players as an array - iterate over array of players with while loop
- scores as an array, take highest
- when you get an ace, check if an 11 wins or busts, should be a 1 and hit? should stay with a 1?
- classes for player, blackjack, card?

__toString() {
  // returns a string
  // concatenate all results into a string to return, e.g.
}


NAMESPACES
- bunch of stuff that lives together
- don't need to explicitly say where it lives because it's in the namespace
- can write functions with the same name in different namespaces

SESSION HANDLING
- _SESSION
- stuff you don't want in the cookie i.e. potentially personally identifiable
- language toggle, game score, remember me
- wiped after a certain amount of time
- files stored on the server

built-in global variables
_SESSION
_REQUEST
_RESPONSE
_COOKIE
