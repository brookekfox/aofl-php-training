NAMESPACES
- bunch of stuff that lives together
- don't need to explicitly say where it lives because it's in the namespace
- can write functions with the same name in different namespaces

SESSION HANDLING
- _SESSION
- stuff you don't want in the cookie i.e. potentially personally identifiable
- language toggle, game score, remember me
- wiped after a certain amount of time
- files stored on the server

built-in global variables
